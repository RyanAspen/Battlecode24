Changes made compared to v21:
- Micro is improved BUT
TODO
    * Rendezvous for attackers
    * Test with reworked micro/macro, then remove/reorganize code
    * Debug defender flagID bug
    * Prioritize flag carriers
    * Prioritize enemies affected by stun traps (also change it so we record enemies stunned and not locations)


Notes:
- v22 almost always beats v21, but improvements can be made

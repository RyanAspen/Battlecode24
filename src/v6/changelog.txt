Changes made compared to v5:
- Completely re-hauled strategy
* Each bot starts out unspecialized but can pick a role to change its behavior once it has
more experience
* The number of each role taken

Notes:
- v6 is the most dominant player so far
- v6 generally attempts plays at multiple flags at the same time and then turtles
once it does so
- The defense is nearly impenetrable once set up due to the water and traps
- Attacking flag carriers aren't defended well, a change in comms might improve this
- Most bots don't go for the flag if given the chance
- Both Attackers and Defenders are stubborn and don't choose new flags if their original flags are taken/moved

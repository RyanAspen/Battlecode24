Changes made compared to v4:
- Improved Comms
- Use Pseudo-random movement for exploration

Notes:
- v5 shows clustering behavior around flag carriers, resulting in slow but strong flag captures
- v5 significantly outperforms v4 in specialization
- v4 usually beats v5 via flag captures due to v4's slowness and lack of defense, but v5 is likely better in the long-term

Changes made compared to v8:
- Reworked Defensive Role
    * Combine Defender and Builder Roles
    * Defensive bot should sit on the flag and place traps near it
        * If a defensive bot is damaged, send out a distress signal
    * Only assign one or two defensive bots per flag (Use Comms to do this)
    * Place bombs specifically near the flags
- Improve Flag Capturing
    * If a bot is adjacent to a friendly flag carrier, move so that it isn't if possible.

- Remove specific Healer role
TODO - Improve Micro
    *
    * Healing should only happen if there is nothing to attack
    * Use Comms to one-shot enemies
    * Attackers should occasionally set traps
    * Attackers should favor movements that keep them close to allies
    * Attackers should stay away from enemies if they have too little health  and there are allies around

Notes:
- v9 generally beats v8
- Defenders need to know whether to stick to protecting their flag or try to protect a new one
- Micro needs improving still

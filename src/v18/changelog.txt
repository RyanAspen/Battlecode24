Changes made compared to v17:
-Rework attack clustering
    * Instead of actively creating cluster points, report locations with many allies (MIN_COUNT_FOR_CLUSTER)
    * Bots should prefer moving toward the closest cluster if they aren't in one (MIN_COUNT_FOR_CLUSTER_MOVE)
    * If there are no clusters OR the bot is already in one, move as normal
- Don't leave the flag if it would result in losing the minimum number of defenders on the existing flag
- If a flag is in danger, try to go there instead to defend
- Deprioritized attacking flag carriers, but never move to attack unless the target is a flag carrier

Notes:
- Pretty much always beats v16 and v17
- Defense is very hard to break once Turtling and all flags are close to each other
- Offense is somewhat stronger as well

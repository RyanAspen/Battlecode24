Changes made compared to v12:
- Overhauled Micro
    * For rounds 170-200, retreat from the dam while placing stun traps
    * One-Shotting no longer used (bad game for it)
    * Instead use a ranking system to determine what to attack
- Crumb Management system added

Notes:
- v13 has significantly better micro than v11 or v12
- Marking system currently isn't used
- Crumb management is still buggy and doesn't make full use of crumbs available

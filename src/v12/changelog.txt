Changes made compared to v11:
- Incorporated actual attack power (with skill level) into One-Shot calculation
- Use Comms for One-Shot (Make sure to fix the attack radius, use enemy ids instead of location)
- Bots only attack on even rounds to make sure all allies can attack at the same time
- Put crumb seeking into Micro, removed econ
- Bots don't kite if they have a numbers advantage
- Bots drop explosive traps in enemy territory (barely used due to crumb management)
    

Notes:
- In direct combat, micro is much better than v11
- v12 always beats v11, sometimes by a lot

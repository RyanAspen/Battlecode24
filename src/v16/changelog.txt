Changes made compared to v15:
* Made Flag Carrier Specific File
        * If we are outnumbered, avoid enemies
        * Move towards the closest spawn that isn't near a flag in danger
        * Should send a signal that all attackers should approach
TODO:
    * Micro Changes (v17)
        * Never approach to attack a clustered enemy (can still attack)
        * Only heal if no enemy is seen. If enemies are seen but cannot attack any, just don't act.
        * Bots should calculate if they could be jailed by next turn in their current location and attempt
        to move to a safe spot if that is the case
        * Bots near enemy flags that don't have an important target should try to fill near the flag (diffuse traps)
        * Bots should mark enemies with high exp in attack or healing
        * Attackers should rendezvous near the flag they attack before attacking
        * If there aren't many allies around, evade larger groups of enemies.
    * Setup Changes
        * If we see enemies and we are in setup, place an explosive trap
        * Don't place stun traps
        * Still move slightly away from dams right before start

Changes made compared to v8:
- Added Clustering (Comms + Attacker changes)
- Attackers now more intelligently choose their flag targets
- Added Capacity for Strategy Changing (Doesn't really do this yet)
- Added Global Upgrade Buying (current not used to make testing more fair)

Notes:
- Typically beats v7, but will occassionally lose on a tiebreaker
- Cluster offense seems to be strong, but there's still the issue of blocking the flag carrier
- Strategy changing doesn't make much sense until we can determine how big of a lead we have
- Flag Comms should be fixed, as they aren't correctly reported (reported when they shouldn't be and vice versa)
- Defenders don't spread out between flags

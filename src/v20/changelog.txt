Changes made compared to v19:
- Exploration reworked
- Added failsafe for flags getting lost during flag moving
- Defenders use stun traps instead of explosive traps
- Dam Setup isn't used if there are crumbs nearby
- Attack calculations now use upgrades
- Strategy now changes if our flags are close together

Notes:
- v20 is better than v19 generally, but it doesn't always beat it

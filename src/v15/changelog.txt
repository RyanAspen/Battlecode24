Changes made compared to v14:
- All Attackers focus one flag
- Friendly Flags are now very well kept track of
- Defenders are evenly distributed around all flags that we still have
- Bots spawn near flags in danger if possible
    * Attackers then try to spawn closest to the flag they are going for
    * Defenders try to spawn near their flag to protect
- Keep track of allied flag counts vs enemy flag counts
    * Modify strategy dynamically depending on the game state
- Micro prioritizes attacking enemies near friendly flags (rank 4, right behind flag carriers)

Notes:
- Economy doesn't keep strategy changes in mind yet (crumb use isn't perfect)
- v15 generally beats v13 and v14
- Much less aggressive play, generally prefers to win at round 2000
    * Average level is much higher when playing defensively

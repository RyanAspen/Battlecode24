Changes made compared to v16:
* Where a defender goes to defend is now based on live defender counts instead of static defender assignments
* All bots will attempt to move to block a flag grab if possible
TODO: Rework attack clustering
    * Instead of actively creating cluster points, report locations with many allies (MIN_COUNT_FOR_CLUSTER)
    * Bots should prefer moving toward the closest cluster if they aren't in one (MIN_COUNT_FOR_CLUSTER_MOVE)
    * If there are no clusters OR the bot is already in one, move as normal

Notes:
- Better than v16, but not by a lot.
- Sometimes too passive

Changes made compared to v6:
- Bots now always go for enemy flags within view, regardless of role
- Attackers and Defenders refresh their targets

Notes:
- Despite the small changes, v7 does significantly better than v6.
- Like v5, v7 forms clusters around friendly flag carriers.
    * Pro: The flag carriers are very difficult to destroy once in a cluster
    * Con: Movement of the flag carrier is hampered by other close bots, maybe
    add an argument to lingerToward() to give a little space to the carrier
